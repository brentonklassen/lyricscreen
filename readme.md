# LyricScreen

A probably-overkill and powerful way of managing lyrics or verse displays for concerts or church services.

**NOTE**: This project is under heavy development and is not recommended for mission-critical functions. 

## Installation

### `pip`

You can get lyricscreen super easily through PyPI! You can check out the
[package page][lyricscreen_pypi] or use [`pip`][pip] as follows:

```bash
pip install lyricscreen
```

### Git

* Clone this repo (`git clone https://github.com/lytedev/lyricscreen`)
* Run the install script (`make install`)

### Windows Installer

**TODO**: Coming soon!

## Basic Usage

### Command Line

If you installed lyricscreen through `pip`, as long as your `PATH` is properly
configured, you should be able to just run `lyricscreen` from your terminal.
lyricscreen should automatically fire up and open a browser page with access
to the web console. It's that simple!

### Windows Installation

**TODO**: Windows installation usage

## Development

* `npm` **N**ode **P**ackage **M*anager (You'll need `node.js` installed)
* `gulp` Streaming build system (`npm install -g gulp`)
* `bower` Front-end package manager (`npm install -g bower`)

For web client development, your work is primarily done in the `WebInterface` directory. Run `npm install` to fetch the node modules we use before running `gulp` to build our app. 

You can also use `gulp watch` to continually build as changes are made. If you use a LiveReload plugin, this also sends refresh messages on file changes for a reload. 

## Concerns

* There is zero security currently implemented. Anyone could theoretically open up their browser and open a console through your http server and do whatever they want.
* Currently absolutely zero ease-of-use and UX. Eventual goal is run the program and have everything pre configured and managable from one interface without needing to edit configs or restart stuff. See TODO list.

## TODO

* Authentication info/system for console connections?
  * Idea: on-run, prompt or generate an admin password, require initial auth from "console" connections. Should be fine enough for short term?
* Better UX for default web admin client
* More complex, optional song formatting options for fancier slides (background images? text-align? Google fonts?)
* Playlist creation/saving/modification/loading/listing/viewing
* Song creation/saving/modification/loading/listing/viewing
* Always: prettier, better organized code (conform to Python code standards and have properly formatted docstrings... or docstrings *at all*)
* YAML config files as an option?
* Nice introduction page for users
