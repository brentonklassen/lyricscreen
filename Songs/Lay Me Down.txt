Lay Me Down

Verse 1A:
With this heart open wide
From the depths from the heights
I will bring a sacrifice

Verse 1B:
With these hands lifted high
Hear my song hear my cry
I will bring a sacrifice
I will bring a sacrifice

ChorusA:
I lay me down
I'm not my own
I belong to you alone
Lay me down
Lay me down

ChorusB:
Lord of my heart
This much is true
There's no life apart from you
Freely now
Lay me down

Verse 2:
Letting go of my pride
Giving up all my rights
Take this life and let it shine
Take this life and let it shine

(ChorusA)

Always
