From the Inside Out

Verse 1a:
A thousand times I've failed
Still your mercy remains
Should I stumble again
Still I'm caught in your grace

Chorus: 
Everlasting, your light will shine when all else fades
Never ending, your glory goes beyond all fame

Verse 2a:
Your will above all else
My purpose remains
The art of losing myself in bringing you praise

(Chorus)

Verse 3a:
In my heart, in my soul
I give you control
Consume me from the inside out

Verse 3b:
Let justice and praise
Become my embrace
To love you from the inside out

(Chorus)

Tag:
And the cry of my heart is to bring you praise
From the inside out
Lord my soul cries out
