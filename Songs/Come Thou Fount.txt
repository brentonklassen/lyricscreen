Come Thou Fount

Verse 1a:
Come, thou Fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing thy grace
Streams of mercy, never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise

Verse 1b:
Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above
Praise the mount! I'm fixed upon it
Mount of thy redeeming love

Verse 2a:
Here I raise mine Ebenezer
Hither by thy help I'm come
And I hope, by thy good pleasure
Safely to arrive at home

Verse 2b:
Jesus sought me when a stranger
Wandering from the fold of God
He, to rescue me from danger
Interposed his precious blood

Verse 3a:
O to grace how great a debtor 
Daily I'm constrained to be
Let thy goodness, like a fetter
Bind my wandering heart to thee

Verse 3b:
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love
Here's my heart, O take and seal it
Seal it for thy courts above
