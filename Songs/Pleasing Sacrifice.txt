You're near to the broken
Your gentleness has made me great

Cause I want my life to be 
A pleasing sacrifice in Your eyes
Give me the fear of the Lord

Search me and know me God
And see if there be any wicked way in me
Give me the fear of the Lord

I wanna be all that you are
I wanna be well pleasing to you
