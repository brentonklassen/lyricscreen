Better is One Day

Verse 1a:
How lovely is
Your dwelling place
Oh Lord Almighty
My soul doth long
And even faint
For You

Verse 1b:
Here my heart
Is satisfied
Within Your presence
I see beneath
The shadow of
Your wings

Chorus:
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere

(Chorus)

(Verse 1a)

(Verse 1b)

(Chorus)

Bridge a:
My heart and flesh cry out
For You, the Living God
Your Spirit's water to my soul

Bridge b:
I've tasted, and I've seen
Come once again to me
I will draw near to You
I will draw near to You
To You

(Chorus)
