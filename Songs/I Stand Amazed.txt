I Stand Amazed

Verse 1:
I stand amazed in the presence
Of Jesus the Nazarene
And wonder how He could love me
A sinner, condemned, unclean

Chorus:
How marvelous! How wonderful!
And my song shall ever be
How marvelous! How wonderful!
Is my Savior's love for me

Verse 2:
He took my sins and my sorrows
He made them His very own
He bore the burden to Calvary
And suffered and died alone

(Chorus)

Verse 3:
When with the ransomed in glory
His face at last I shall see
'Twill be my joy through the ages
To sing of His love for me

(Chorus)
