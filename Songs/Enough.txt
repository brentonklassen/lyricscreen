Enough
by Chris Tomlin

Chorus:
All of You is more than 
Enough for all of me
For every thirst and every need
You satisfy me with Your love
And all I have in You 
Is more than enough

You are my supply
My breath of life
And still more awesome than I know
You are my reward
Worth living for
And still more awesome than I know

(Chorus)

You're my sacrifice
Of greatest price
And still more awesome than I know
You're the coming King
You are everything
And still more awesome than I know

(Chorus)

Bridge:
More than all I want
More than all I need
You are more than enough for me
More than all I know
More than all I can say
You are more than enough for me

(Chorus)

Tag:
And all I have in You
Is more than enough
