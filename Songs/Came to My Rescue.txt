Came to My Rescue

Verse 1:
Falling on my knees in worship
Giving all I am to seek Your face
Lord all I am is Yours

Verse 2:
My whole life
I place in Your hands
God of Mercy
Humbled I bow down
In Your presence at Your throne

Chorus:
I called You answered
And You came to my rescue and I
Wanna be where You are

(Verse 2)

(Chorus) 

(Chorus)

Bridge:
In my life be lifted high
In our world be lifted high
In our love be lifted high

(Bridge)

(Chorus)

(Chorus)
