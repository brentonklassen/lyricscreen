Rescue

Verse 1:
You are the source of life
I can't be left behind
No one else will do
I will take hold of You

Chorus:
I need You Jesus to come to my rescue
Where else can I go?
There's no other Name by which I am saved
Capture me with grace
I will follow You

This world has nothing for me 
I will follow You

Ending:
I'm coming Your way
I'm coming Your way
I'm coming Your way
