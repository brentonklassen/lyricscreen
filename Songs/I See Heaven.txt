Invading this place

And I sing praises
I sing praises
I give You honor
Worthy Jesus

Falling in this place
I see hope restored
Healing of all disease

And I sing praises
I sing praises
I give You honor

We give You Praise
And all of the Honor
You are our God
The one we live for
We give You Praise
And all of the Glory God

(Chorus)

Bridge a:
Let Your Presence fill this place
Let Heaven come
Let Your angels be released
Let Heaven come

We will worship at Your feet
Let Heaven come
Face to face we want to meet
Let Heaven come
