Great I Am

Verse 1a:
I want to be close
Close to Your side
So Heaven is real
And death is a lie

Verse 1b:
I want to hear 
Voices of angels above 
Singing as one

Chorus:
Hallelujah, holy, holy
God Almighty, the great I AM
Who is worthy, none beside Thee
God Almighty, the great I AM

Verse 2a:
I want to be near
Near to Your heart
Loving the world 
And hating the dark

Verse 2b:
I want to see dry bones
Living again
Singing as one

(Chorus)

Tag 1:
The great I AM

Bridge A:
The mountains shake before You
The demons run in fear
At the mention of the name 
King of Majesty

Bridge B:
There is no power in hell
Or any who can stand
Before the power 
And the presence of the great I AM

(Chorus)
