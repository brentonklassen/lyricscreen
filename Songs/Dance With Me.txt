Dance With Me

Verse 1:
Behold You have come over the hills
Over the mountains
To me You have run my Beloved
You've captured my heart

Chorus:
Dance with me O Lover of my soul
To the song of all songs
Romance me O Lover of my soul
To the song of all songs

Verse 2:
With You I will go
You are my Love
You are my fair One
The winter is past
And the springtime has come

(Chorus)

(Chorus)

Tag:
Dance with me, Dance with me
Dance with me, Dance with me
Dance with me, Dance with me
Dance with me, Lover of my soul
To the songs of all songs
