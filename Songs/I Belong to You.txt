I Belong to You

Verse 1:
You're more real than the wind in my lungs
You're more real than the ground I'm standing on

Verse 2:
You're thoughts define me, you're inside me
You're my reality

Chorus:
Abba, I belong to you
Abba, I belong to you

Verse 3:
You're closer than the skin on my bones
You're closer than the song on my tongue
