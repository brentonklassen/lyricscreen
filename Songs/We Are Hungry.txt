We Are Hungry

Lord I want more of You
Living water rain down on me
Lord I need more of You
Living breath of life come fill me up

Lord I want more of You
Living water rain down on me
Lord I need more of You
Living breath of life come and fill me up

Chorus:
We are hungry
We are hungry
We are hungry for more of You
We are thirsty, oh Jesus
We are thirsty for more of You

Lord I want more of you
Holy Spirit rain down on me
Lord I need more of you
Living breath of life come and fill me up

(Chorus)

(Chorus)

More of You
We are hungry for the more of You
We are thirsty

We lift our holy hands up
We want to touch You
We lift our voices higher and higher and higher to You

We lift our holy hands up
We want to touch You
We lift our voices higher and higher and higher to You

(Chorus)

(Chorus)

We lift our holy hands up
We want to touch you
We lift our voices higher
And higher and higher to you

We lift our holy hands up
We want to touch you
We lift our voices higher
And higher to You

We lift our holy hands up
We want to touch you
We lift our voices higher
And higher to You
