Holy is the Lord

We stand and lift up our hands
For the joy of the Lord is our strength
We bow down and worship Him now
How great, how awesome is He

And together we sing

Chorus:
Holy is the Lord God Almighty
The earth is filled with His glory
Holy is the Lord God Almighty
The earth is filled with His glory
The earth is filled with His glory

We stand and lift up our hands
For the joy of the Lord is our strength
We bow down and worship Him now
How great, how awesome is He

And together we sing,
Everyone sing

(Chorus)

Repeatin:
It's rising up all around
It's the anthem of the Lord's renown

(Repeatin)

(Repeatin)

(Repeatin)

And together we sing,
Everyone sing

(Chorus)
