The Stand

Verse 1:
You stood before creation
Eternity in your hand
You spoke the earth into motion
My soul now to stand

Verse 2:
You stood before my failure
And carried the cross for my shame
My sin weighed upon your shoulders
My soul now to stand

Chorus:
So what could I say?
And what could I do?
But offer this heart, Oh God
Completely to you

Verse 3: 
So I'll walk upon salvation
Your spirit alive in me
This life to declare your promise
My soul now to stand

(Chorus) 

Bridge:
I'll stand
With arms high and heart abandoned
In awe of the one who gave it all
I'll stand
My soul Lord to You surrendered
All I am is Yours

(Bridge)
