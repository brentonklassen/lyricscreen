So Good to Me

Verse 1a:
I waited patiently upon the Lord
And He inclined and heard my cry
He pulled me up out of the miry clay

Verse 1b:
He set my feet upon the Rock
He gave me beauty for ashes
And joy for my mourning

Verse 1c:
And praise for heaviness
He put a new song in my mouth
And a crown upon my head
He gave me life forevermore

Chorus:
He’s been
So good, so, so good to me
So good, so, so good to me
So good, so, so good to me
Jesus

(Chorus)

(Chorus)

Post-chorus:
He picked me up
And He turned me around
And He set my feet
On the solid ground
Hallelujah, hallelujah

Tag:
I’ve got love, joy, peace
And righteousness 
Here in the Holy Spirit

(Chorus)
