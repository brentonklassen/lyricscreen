You Alone

Verse 1:
You are the only one I need
I bow all of me at Your feet
I worship You alone

Verse 2:
You have given me more than
I could ever have wanted
And I want to give You my heart and my soul

Chorus:
You alone are Father
And You alone are good
You alone are Savior
And You alone are God

(Verse 1)

(Verse 2)

(Chorus)

Bridge
I'm alive, I'm alive
I'm alive, I'm alive
