The More I Seek You

Chorus:
The more I seek you
the more I find you

(Chorus)

Verse 1:
I wanna sit at your feet
drink from the cup in your hand
Lay back against you and breath
hear your heart beat

Verse 2:
This love is so deep
it's more than I can stand
I melt in your peace
It's overwhelming 

(Chorus)
