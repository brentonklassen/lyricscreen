Example Playlist
# That's a long title! Again, the pound symbol denotes comments. Useful!

# All playlists filenames should end in ".txt" - this may change, but for now,
# this is what the program expects.

# You should copy this file and rename it "Default.txt"
# The Default.txt Playlist file is loaded by default if it exists and is a nice
# quick way to be up and running.

# List your songs file names here - exclude the ".txt"
